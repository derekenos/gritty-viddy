Realish-time in-browser video effects using vanilla Javascript.


## Install the Development Dependencies

You'll need `node` (v13.8.9 or compatible) and `npm` (v6.13.6 or compatible) installed.

I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to install/manage your node versions.

```
npm install
```


## Start the Development Server

```
npm run dev
```

## Build a Standalone `index.html`

```
npm run build
```

You'll find the result at: `build/dist/index.html`
